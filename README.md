Decaf Parser with Korean Language Support
This project, part of the Principles of Compiler course, focuses on adapting a Decaf parser to work with the Korean language. The goal is to modify the parser so it can recognize and process Korean syntax, enabling accurate interpretation of Korean input.

Project Objectives
Adapt Grammar Rules: Modify the Decaf parser's grammar to align with the structure and syntax rules of the Korean language, including adjustments for word order and particle usage unique to Korean.
Support Character Encoding: Configure the parser to handle Korean characters (Hangul), ensuring compatibility with UTF-8 or other multi-byte character encodings.
Lexical Analysis for Korean: Update the lexical analysis component to recognize Korean words, phrases, and symbols.
Enhanced Error Handling: Implement error messages that are meaningful for Korean syntax, providing feedback that helps users understand Korean-specific syntax issues.

Why Korean?
This project showcases the flexibility of the Decaf parser and demonstrates how changes to grammar and lexical components can enable support for non-English languages.
